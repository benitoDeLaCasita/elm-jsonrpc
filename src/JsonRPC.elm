{-| This library helps with building and chaining stateful JSON RPC
requests. While running a single RPC request (and handling all
potential outcomes) or simple chaining stateless requests is
straightforward using built-in means of Elm, it becomes more difficult
when several requests need to be run with one depending - both in
terms of the result and side-effects - on the previous.


# RPC context

Every RPC request (or RPC command, see below) needs an instance of
`Context`. In most cases you don't need to access the instance
itself, but you may access the state that the context instance wraps.
The state can be anything your application needs, from a single
integer to the full application model.

@docs Context


# The `Command` type

Every request is of the following type:

@docs Command

The three type variables are:

  - `state` - request state, anything that you need to pass between
    commands, see above
  - `err` - error type (typically `Http.Error` or something wrapping
    it)
  - `a` - the type that the request eventually evaluates to.

With `request` you can build individual commands, but other tools are
needed to chain commands (`andThen`) and to build special commands.

Finally, when your chain of commands is ready, launch it with `run`.

{-| Transform the error value. This can be useful when you need to
change the error type; for instance, you need to process two types of errors

    type AppError
        = HttpErr Http.Error
        | OtherErr String

But since `request` yields a command with `Http.Error`, you need to
transform the command like

    request ...
        |> mapError HttpErr
